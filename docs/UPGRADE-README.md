```

**URL Encoding:**
- Space → ` `
- Newline → `%0A`
- # → `#`

**When Clicked:**
1. Opens WhatsApp
2. Shows contact/group picker
3. Pre-fills message with product details
4. User sends to chosen contact
5. Recipient clicks link → lands on YOUR product page

### **Deep Linking:**

Products use anchor IDs:
```html
<div id="dell-latitude-5420" class="product-card">
```

Links include hash:
```
https://dhanutech.in/products.html#dell-latitude-5420
```

JavaScript auto-scrolls and highlights the product when accessed via shared link.
