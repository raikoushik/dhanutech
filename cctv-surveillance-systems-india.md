# CCTV Surveillance Systems: A Smart Security Guide for Homes and Businesses in India

Security is a daily concern for families and businesses across India. A CCTV camera is now one of the most useful tools to protect homes, shops, offices, schools, clinics, and storage areas.

A modern security camera system does more than record video. It helps you watch live activity, receive alerts, and keep evidence if an incident happens. For families, this supports better home surveillance. For business owners, office CCTV improves safety and control.

If you are planning a new setup, this guide will help you choose the best CCTV system in simple language.

## What is CCTV and How It Works

CCTV means Closed-Circuit Television. Cameras capture video and send it to a recorder. You can watch footage live, review past clips, and often check everything from your phone.

A basic setup includes:

- CCTV camera units
- DVR or NVR recorder
- Hard disk or cloud storage
- Monitor or mobile app
- Internet (for remote viewing)

Many systems offer motion alerts, so you can react quickly when activity is detected.

## Types of CCTV Cameras

Different spaces need different camera types.

### Dome Camera

Dome cameras are compact and neat. They are ideal for indoor use in homes, shops, and office lobbies. Their design makes lens direction less obvious.

### Bullet Camera

Bullet cameras are visible and strong for outdoor use. They are commonly installed at gates, parking areas, and boundary walls.

### PTZ Camera

PTZ means Pan, Tilt, Zoom. These cameras can move and zoom, so they are useful in large areas like campuses, warehouses, and yards.

### IP Camera

IP cameras work on a network and usually provide clearer video with smart app features. They are popular for modern home and office CCTV setups.

### Wireless Camera

Wireless cameras reduce cable work and are easy to install in homes and small offices. Stable Wi-Fi is important for smooth performance.
